# Quiz Time 

This website has been created as the second Milestone project for Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development Diploma. It was built using HTML and CSS. GitPod was used for writing the code for this website, as well as committing and pushing to GitHub. GitHub was then used to store the project after it had been pushed from GitPod. Once all the code had been written, GitPages was then used to deploy the website. 

This website is a fun and easy to play Movies & TV Shows quiz game.
It was designed to allow users to take 5 minutes out of their day to unwind and have a bit of fun.

## Site Goals:

The goals for this site are as follows:
* To provide users with a fun interactive game.
* To test the users knowledge of 'x'.

## UX:

### User stories:
#### New User:  
* As a new user, I am looking to find play an online game that tests my knowledge of 'x'  
* As a new user, I would like to keep trace of my score as I progress through the quiz.  
* As a new user, I would like to get live feedback of my answers.   

#### Returning User:
* As a returning user, I would like to check if there has been any new questions added.
* As a returning user, I would like to attempt to beat my previous score.
* As a returning user, I would like to see a leader board of the top 10 scorers.

## Development Planes:
To create a website that is comprehensive and informative for a user, as a developer you need to look at all aspects of the website and how someone who visits your website will use it. You have to consider all the user stories that have been outlined in the above sections.  

## Strategy
The strategy principal looks at user needs, as well product/service objectives. This websites target audience was broken down into three categories:
### Roles: 
* New User
* Existing User  

### Demographic:
*   

### Psychographic:
#### Lifestyle:
*   
#### Values:
*  

#### The website needs to allow users to:  
* Easily enter a username   
* Get live feedback of if the answer is correct or incorrect 
* See the correct answer if they answered incorrect  
* See a running total of their score
* Provide a top 10 scorers board when the quiz has been completed  


#### The website needs to allow the developer to:  
* Keep track of all usernames being added so no name is used more than once   
* Keep track of all scores that will be displayed on the top 10 scorers board  

## Scope:  

With the structure in place, it was then time to move onto the scope plane. This was all about developing website requirements based on the goals set out in the strategy plane. These requirements are broken down into two categories. 

### Content Requirements:
1. The user will be looking for:
      * 
### Functionality Requirements:
1. The user will be able to:
      * 


## Structure:

The information above was then used to create a structure for the website. Below is a site map showing how users can navigate the website intuitively

</details>


## Skeleton:
[Wireframes](WIREFRAME.md "Link to Wireframe screenshots") were created to set out the initial appearance of the website while also making sure to keep the end-user in mind at all times. Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).  

## Surface:
[Please see the live site here]  


### Color: 
To create a visually appealing website but also a website that was easy for people to read I used several different sites to test color contrast. I wanted to make sure the color scheme was not only eye-catching but also that it passed the LightHouse Accessibility test. 

Initially, I looked at what colors work best with the 'x' color I had chosen as my main color. I did this by using a color wheel.  
![Color Wheel](assets/readme-images/Color-ombinations-Cheat-Sheet.png)


Following on from the color wheel, an orange was decided upon to contrast the purple. To make sure text could be seen without issue on my chosen colors I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) color contrast checker.

### Font:

 

### Images:

The imagery on this site was sourced from [Pexel](https://www.pexels.com/)

All these images were uploaded to the site initially and were placed on the gallery page. After working with images from Pexel on other projects, it was known that these images are quite large and take a lot of time to load. For this reason before uploading the images were compressed to suit the websites needs.
